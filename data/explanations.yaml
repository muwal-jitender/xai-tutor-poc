  offer_diagnostic: >
    To tailor your path, I recommend a quick diagnostic (5–8 items).
    It helps confirm prerequisites before Big-O. You can skip if you prefer.

  review_prereq: >
    Recommending a short review of {{skill_title}} because your score was {{score_correct}}/{{score_total}}.
    This concept supports {{next_title}}. If you had scored ≥ {{threshold}}, I would have advanced.

  advance: >
    Moving to {{next_title}} because your recent score on {{from_title}} was {{score_correct}}/{{score_total}} (≥ {{threshold}}).
    Confidence: {{confidence}}.

  ask_question_intro: >
    Let’s check {{skill_title}} with a quick question.

  answer_content_note: >
    Here’s a concise explanation of {{topic}}. Since you skipped diagnostics, consider a 5-question check
    if any part feels unclear.

  generic_counterfactual: >
    If your performance on {{from_title}} were higher, I would proceed to {{next_title}}.
